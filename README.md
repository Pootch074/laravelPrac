LaravelPrac is a Laravel-based project created for practice and development. To get this application running on your local machine, follow the steps below.

First, make sure you have PHP, Composer, and a web server (like Apache or Laravel's built-in server) installed on your system. It's also recommended to have Laravel CLI and a database system like MySQL set up.

Start by cloning the repository to your local machine using Git. In your terminal, run:

<!--
git clone https://github.com/your-username/laravelPrac.git
cd laravelPrac
 -->

Once inside the project directory, you need to set up your environment configuration. Laravel includes a sample file called .env.example. Copy this file to a new file named .env using the command:

<!--
cp .env.example .env
 -->

Next, install all the PHP dependencies required for the project by running:

<!--
composer install
 -->

After installing the dependencies, generate the application key. This key is used by Laravel to secure encrypted data. Run the following Artisan command:

<!--
php artisan key:generate
 -->

Before running the application, you may need to update the .env file with your local environment settings, such as database connection details, if the project requires a database.

Now, you can start the development server using Laravel’s built-in command:

<!--
php artisan serve
 -->

This will start the server, and your Laravel application will be accessible at http://localhost:8000 in your web browser.

If your application includes database migrations, you can run them with:

<!--
php artisan migrate
 -->

That’s it! Your laravelPrac project should now be up and running.
